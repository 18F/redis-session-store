A simple Redis-based session store for Redis. But why, you ask,
when there's [redis-store](http://github.com/jodosha/redis-store/)?
redis-store is a one-fits-all solution, and I found it not to work
properly with Rails, mostly due to a problem that seemed to lie in
Rack's Abstract::ID class. I wanted something that worked, so I
blatantly stole the code from Rails' MemCacheStore and turned it
into a Redis version. No support for fancy stuff like distributed
storage across several Redis instances. Feel free to add what you
seem fit.

Installation
============

gem install redis-session-store

You know the rest.

Configuration
=============

See lib/redis-session-store.rb for a list of valid options.
